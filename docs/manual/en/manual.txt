This documents describes usage of the https://github.com/jpcima/faustpp[*Faust post-processor*], a flexible code generator for Faust source files. +
https://faust.grame.fr/[Faust], or "Functional Audio Stream", is a programming language and compiler for signal processing developed at http://www.grame.fr/[GRAME].

NOTE: If you encounter a problem with the software, please open an issue on the project page: +
https://github.com/jpcima/faustpp/issues

== Description

This is a code generator for Faust with a particularity: it offers advanced control on the format of generated code.

Usually, the code output from the Faust compiler will be a single implementation file written in C++ or another language,
and it exposes some methods to instantiate the object, control it, and access some of its characteristics.

However, because such generated code is so monolithic, it is not always easy to embed it as a part of a larger program,
in a separate compilation model, without violating the _DRY principle_ ("Don't repeat yourself").
These units also offer some introspection abilities, whose model is dynamic rather than static, which may be considered unpractical.

The novelty of this post-processor over Faust is to substitute the concept of _architectures_, used to generate many flavors of programs,
with _architecture templates_ whose processing is backed by a https://github.com/pantor/inja[templating engine].
The concepts are quite similiar, except templates allow to express it with greater power.

== Quick start

This needs the Faust compiler version 0.9.85 or greater, as well as Faustpp installed on the system.

The following is the minimal invocation of the program.
The result is a pair of files, a source and a header, ready to by included in a project.

....
faustpp -DIdentifier=MyEffect -a generic.cpp MyEffect.dsp > MyEffect.cpp
faustpp -DIdentifier=MyEffect -a generic.hpp MyEffect.dsp > MyEffect.hpp
....

These options are *required*:

* `-DIdentifier=MyEffect`: this defines the name of the class in generated source code.
* `-a generic.cpp`: this selects the architecture file to use. For most cases, `generic` is adequate; it is available under the `architectures` directory.

== Command-line options

The program may be invoked with the following options:

* `-a <architecture-file>`: selects the architecture file to use. This is a template file expressed in https://github.com/pantor/inja[Inja] syntax.
* `-D<name=value>`: defines a variable in the environment of the template engine, to modify the behavior of the generation.
* `-X<faust-arg>`: passes the `faust-arg` argument to the faust compiler. These arguments are passed to the compiler in the same order as they are specified.
For example, if you want to enable double precision processing, pass `-X-double`.

WARNING: If you use `-X` options to generate multiple related files, such as `.cpp` and `.hpp` files, make absolutely sure to pass the same `-X` flags in every invocation of the program.

== Using the provided templates

The program comes with its own set of templates, which can be used directly or adapted to particular needs.
The templates are located under the `architectures` folder of the software distribution.

The templates can be parameterized with `-D` options, which are explained in their respective sections.

Refer to the `examples` directory for a few examples which use these templates.

=== The generic template

The `generic` template produces a class which is ready to include in other source code for direct use.

The result offers the following abilities:

* a split generation into a header and an implementation file
* a direct introspection of the characteristics of the controls
* recognition of some custom metadata for widgets: `[symbol:]`, `[trigger]`, `[boolean]`, `[integer]`
* named getters and setters for the controls
* a simplified signature for the processing routine

[#generic-options]
==== Options

.`-DIdentifier=<id>`
The name of the generated class which wraps the processing code of the Faust module. *[String]*

[#generic-metadata]
==== Metadata

.`Widget.symbol`
The C-style identifier which names the control in the generated code, and its getter/setter pair. *[String]* +
The name is also adequate for use with the `lv2:symbol` property of the LV2 plugin specification.

.`Widget.trigger`
This indicates that the widget works like a trigger, similarly to the `button` widget. *[Boolean]* +
Setting this property on `hslider` or `vslider` allows to define the value domain.

.`Widget.boolean`
This indicates that the widget works like a boolean, similarly to the `checkbox` widget. *[Boolean]* +
Setting this property on `hslider` or `vslider` allows to define the value domain and the initial value.

.`Widget.integer`
This indicates that the widget is valued on an integer scale. *[Boolean]*

=== The oversampled template

The `oversampled` template produces a class which operates exactly like `generic` from user perspective,
except it implements transparent oversampling by a fixed factor.

The source code of the Faust module should be adapted to take in consideration the oversampling ratio, as defined by this Faust statement:
`OS = fconstant(int gOversampling, <math.h>);`

It accepts all options recognized by the `generic` template, as well as additional ones as documented below.

==== Options

See also <<generic-options,Generic template options>>.

.`-DOversampling=<ratio>`
The oversampling ratio, which is either of the following values: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`. *[Integer]*

==== Metadata

See also <<generic-metadata,Generic template metadata>>.

== Creating architecture templates

The template files are expressed in https://github.com/pantor/inja[Inja] syntax.

These files are mostly comprised of static text, and particular tags inside of it which are interpreted by the templating engine,

* `+{{...}}+` blocks are known as *expressions*, they substitute with the evaluation of their content.
* `+{%...%}+` blocks are known as *statements*, they can express control flow such as iterations and conditionals.
* `+{#...#}+` blocks are known as *comments*, they are ignored.

Refer to the documentation of the templating engine for details.

To get a better idea, examine existing templates from the `architectures` folder.

=== Template variable reference

A set of variables are made available to the template, describing the Faust source which is compiled.

.`name`
The name of the Faust module. *[String]*

.`author`
The author of the Faust module. *[String]*

.`copyright`
The copyright of the Faust module. *[String]*

.`license`

.`inputs`

.`meta`
A dictionary containing all the file-level metadata. *[Object]* +
In Faust source code, this is the information provided by `declare` statements at the top-level.

.`active`

Active controls are input parameters, represented by buttons, sliders or knobs.

.`passive`

Passive controls are output parameters, usually used for display or analysis purposes.

.`class_code`
The source code of the class generated by the Faust compiler, in raw and minimal form. *[String]*

==== The Widget object

.`Widget.type`
The type of the widget. *[String]* +

This is one of the following values:

* actives: `button`, `checkbox`, `vslider`, `hslider`, `nentry`
* passives: `vbargraph`, `hbargraph`

.`Widget.label`
The display name of the widget. *[String]*

.`Widget.var`

.`Widget.init`
The default value of the widget. *[Number]*

.`Widget.min`
The minimum value of the widget. *[Number]*

.`Widget.max`
The maximum value of the widget. *[Number]*

.`Widget.step`
The step value, or resolution of the widget. *[Number]*

.`Widget.unit`

.`cstr(str)`
Convert a string to a quoted string literal in C syntax. *[String] → [String]*

.`cid(str)`
Convert a string to an identifier which is valid in C syntax. *[String] → [String]*
